    <h2>Recognizing the good</h2>
    <p>Rojee, you're a lovely person inside and out with many great qualities.
      You're caring, silly, smart and beautiful to name a few.
      <br>We've shared many great memories; fun adventures, great conversations and lots of cozy time doing nothing.
      <br>Our personalities positively interact with one another in a handful of ways.
    <br>
    <br>
    We have no doubt had our fair share of issues lately and it has been emotionally exhausting for both of us.<br>
    That being said, after thinking about us, what has been and what could be,<br>
    I am not satisfied with the answer that we are simply not compatible or looking for different things.<br>
    I don't believe this is what drove us apart.<br><br>
   Successful relationships are characterized by mutual respect, effective communication, trust & empathy.<br>
   Both partners have to work as a team, openly communicating needs, while listening to and responding to the needs of their partner.<br>
   With healthy communication and patience, we can give each other the opportunity to learn and grow as humans and as partners.<br>
   This fosters an environment that minimizes issues and manages conflict resolution in a healthy way.<br>
   This type of equal and caring partnership allows each person to blossom into their best and happiest self.

    <h2>I am not Perfect</h2>
    <p>I have my flaws and you have given me constructive feedback that I have taken to heart.<br><br>
      You have brought things into my awareness and helped me understand how I have, at times, negatively affected you.<br><br>
      I need to work on myself, manage difficult emotions in a healthy way and and not let my stress and frustration affect those around me.<br><br>
      I need to, at times, be more patient and understanding.<br><br>
      I need to be more assertive and set boundaries when necessary.<br><br>
      Among other things, I am happy to look into therapy as well as getting my driver's license.<br><br>
      I understand I have things I can work on as a person and as a partner that would positively impact myself and our dynamic.</p>

      <h2>Unhealthy Defensive Mechanisms in Relationships:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Past Relationship Trauma:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Previous experiences of hurt or betrayal in relationships have led
            to deep emotional scars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instances of abandonment, rejection, or betrayal contribute to this
            trauma.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Formation of Defensive Mechanisms:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To shield oneself from further pain, individuals develop defensive
            mechanisms as coping strategies.
          </li>
          <li>
            These mechanisms serve as psychological barriers aimed at
            self-protection and emotional preservation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pushing Away Behavior:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Individuals may push away or distance themselves from their partner
            as a defensive mechanism.
          </li>
          <li>
            This behavior includes emotional withdrawal, avoidance, or creating
            barriers in communication and intimacy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Attacking as Self-Protection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Attacking or criticizing one's partner serves as a means of
            self-protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Criticizing the partner's flaws may deflect attention away from
            one's own vulnerabilities and insecurities.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rooted in Fear of Rejection:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Defensive behaviors stem from a deep-seated fear of being hurt,
            rejected, or abandoned again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Individuals believe that pushing their partner away can prevent
            similar pain in the future.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Overemphasis on Partner's Flaws:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Focusing excessively on the partner's flaws serves as a defense
            mechanism.
          </li>
          <li>
            Magnifying imperfections justifies emotional detachment and
            minimizes vulnerability.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Being Overly Demanding:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some individuals may become overly demanding on their partner,
            expecting them to fulfill unrealistic expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            This behavior can lead to a power imbalance in the relationship.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Passive Role of the Partner:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As a result of being overly demanding, the partner may assume a
            passive role, suppressing their needs to avoid conflict.
          </li>
          <li>
            They may prioritize appeasing their partner over expressing their
            own needs and desires.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consequence of Power Imbalance:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The power imbalance perpetuates unhealthy dynamics in the
            relationship, with one partner exerting control while the other
            suppresses their autonomy.
          </li>
          <li>
            This can lead to frustration, disappointment, and ultimately, a
            strain on trust and intimacy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
<li><strong>Cycles of Dysfunction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Defensive patterns, such as preemptively pushing away or attacking the partner, perpetuate self-fulfilling prophecies where fear leads to behaviors that sabotage the relationship.</li>
      <li>This cycle intertwines with the dynamic of being overly demanding and assuming a passive role, reinforcing dysfunctional patterns.</li>
      <li>Without addressing these underlying issues, the relationship may continue to deteriorate.</li>
